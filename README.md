Ali CLIA simple and powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool built with TypeScript, yargs, and @inquirer/prompts to help you manage your shell aliases efficiently. Stop cluttering your .bashrc or .zshrc directly and let ali handle your alias collection!FeaturesEasy Alias Management: Add, list, and remove shell aliases with intuitive commands.Persistent Storage: Aliases are stored in a clean JSON file in your home directory (~/.ali-cli/aliases.json).Shell Integration: Generates a shell script (~/.ali-cli/aliases.sh) that you can easily source in your shell's configuration file for seamless access to your aliases.Interactive Prompts: Uses @inquirer/prompts for user confirmation (e.g., before overwriting or removing aliases).Clear Output: Utilizes chalk for colored and readable terminal output.Global Options: Supports short flags like ali -l to quickly list aliases.InstallationTo get ali-cli up and running on your system, follow these steps:Clone the repository (or create your project locally):git clone https://github.com/your-username/ali-cli.git
cd ali-cli
(If you're building it from scratch, just navigate to your project directory.)Install dependencies:npm install
Build the TypeScript project:npm run build
This will compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript in the dist/ directory.Link the CLI for global access (for development/testing):npm link
This command makes ali available as a global command in your terminal.Usage1. Initialize the CLIFirst, you need to initialize ali to set up its configuration files and integrate with your shell.ali init
Follow the on-screen instructions. This command will:Create the ~/.ali-cli/ directory.Create an empty ~/.ali-cli/aliases.json file to store your aliases.Generate the ~/.ali-cli/aliases.sh script.Crucially, it will tell you to add a line like source "~/.ali-cli/aliases.sh" to your shell's configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, ~/.profile). You only need to do this once.After adding the source line, remember to reload your shell configuration (e.g., source ~/.bashrc) or open a new terminal session for the changes to take effect.2. Managing AliasesOnce initialized, you can use ali to manage your aliases:Add an Aliasali add <alias-name> "<command-to-alias>"
# Example:
ali add gcl "git clone --depth 1"
ali add gs "git status -sb"
If an alias already exists, ali will prompt you for confirmation before overwriting it.List All Aliasesali list
# Or using the shorthand flag:
ali -l
This will display all aliases currently stored in your aliases.json file.Remove an Aliasali remove <alias-name>
# Example:
ali remove gcl
```ali` will ask for confirmation before permanently removing an alias.

#### Synchronize Shell Aliases Script

Normally, `ali add` and `ali remove` automatically update the `aliases.sh` script. However, if you manually edit `~/.ali-cli/aliases.json` or suspect an issue, you can force a synchronization:

```bash
ali sync
After running ali sync, you will still need to re-source your shell configuration (e.g., source ~/.bashrc) for the changes to become active in your current terminal session.Run an Alias (for testing purposes)While you'll typically run aliases directly in your shell after sourcing, you can use the run command to test them:ali run <alias-name> [additional arguments...]
# Example:
ali run gcl my-repo-url
ConfigurationThe ali-cli stores its configuration and aliases in your home directory:Configuration Directory: ~/.ali-cli/Aliases Data File: ~/.ali-cli/aliases.json (a JSON file containing key-value pairs of alias name and command)Shell Integration Script: ~/.ali-cli/aliases.sh (the script generated by ali that you source in your shell config)ContributingContributions are welcome!
